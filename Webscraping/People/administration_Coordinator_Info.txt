Bio:
Greetings and welcome to the Master of Science (M.S.) in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Florida!
As the program coordinator, I am excited to lead a team of dedicated faculty and staff committed to your academic and professional success. The MSAIS program aims to meet the demand for skilled professionals who can navigate the complexities of the artificial intelligence (AI) field. Through an interdisciplinary approach, we provide students with a comprehensive skillset, merging knowledge from diverse fields such as computer science, mathematics, engineering, and ethics.
A unique feature of our program is the flexibility it offers through elective courses. You have the opportunity to customize your curriculum by choosing three elective courses from a variety of concentration areas.
Iâ€™m thrilled to guide you through this educational journey and help you achieve your academic and professional aspirations.
All the best,
Catia
